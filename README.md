This is the *Learning Progress Tracker* project I made myself.

Practice loops and flow controls, functional decomposition, and SOLID principles with OOP. Learn how to process strings with Regular Expressions and leverage the unittest framework to make sure that your code is error-free. Use suitable collections such as dictionaries to access and modify data and lists to sort and filter data.

Online learning is gaining popularity. A good education platform can manage registrations, track learning progress, send notifications and newsletters to many users worldwide. It is a huge volume of work indeed. In this project, you will build an application that keeps track of the registered users, their learning progress, and metrics. It will also provide detailed information about each user or any category of users and the overall statistics for the entire learning platform.

This project does the following tasks:

* Setup the core of your program: read input, detect a pre-defined set of commands, and respond accordingly.
* Verify new users by checking their registration information. In this stage, your program should read information about users from the console and verify that it matches certain patterns.
* Adjust your program to store the learning progress. Your program should be able to verify that the provided information has the right format and update the user records accordingly.
* Output the statistics about students and courses. Teach your program to calculate and output the details about the courses based on multiple criteria.
* Find out who the best students are and send personal messages to them.
